Planned and programmed a web application on a team with two peers that allows users to find the elected officials that represent them. Designed and created databases to store elected official information and elected office locations using Cloud Firestore, PostgreSQL, and PostGIS. Developed backend microservices to query officeholders and their locations using Python/Flask and Apollo/GraphQL. Constructed the application's cloud architecture with automated builds and deployments using Gitlab CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Google Cloud Platform.
